# Description

In this repository I present a small application that solves random instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) through the resolution of three different classic mathematical models. 

The application is implemeted in Python 3, PyQt6 framework to create the GUI and PuLp library to implement ahd solve the mathematical models. 

The objective of this application is just present an easy way to create a friendly interface to interact with optimization algorithms and visualize the results obtained by them.
